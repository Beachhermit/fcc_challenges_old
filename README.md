# fcc_challenges
Record of code submitted for challenges

First goal, to get more comfortable with Github environment.

Second goal, save code from challenges so can revisit and find ways to improve as I learn more.

Third goal, work out how to coordinate this with Cloud-9, or perhaps some other IDE because the FCC IDE where I've been working on the challenges is so frustrating. I can't find a debugger on there - have been using console.log statements. Also, when it runs tests, it says what it was expecting, that it didn't get what it was expecting, but doesn't show you what it did get (except for the test built in to the challenge template). "getIndexToIns([10, 20, 30, 40, 50], 35) should return 3." There has to be a better way to do this!
